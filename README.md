Summary of the pdf
Your Question: Summary of the pdf
Answer:
The PDF is titled "Crafting a Rule of Life" and is published by Emotionally Healthy Discipleship. It introduces the concept of a "Rule of Life" as a structure to facilitate loving union with God, and provides a worksheet for crafting a personal Rule of Life. The Rule of Life involves identifying daily rhythms and activities that help one remain anchored in Christ, as well as identifying activities to avoid, limit, or eliminate that pull one away from Christ. The worksheet also prompts the reader to consider challenging "have to's" in the next 3-6 months that will impact their rhythms, and to ask God what he is inviting them to focus on during this season.
